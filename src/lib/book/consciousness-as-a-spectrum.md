# Consciousness as a spectrum

> *What does it mean to be aware of something?*

To be aware of something means to have knowledge or perception of a situation or fact. Awareness encompasses both the act of noticing something using one's senses (sight, sound, touch, taste, smell) and the cognitive processes involved in recognizing, understanding, and interpreting what has been noticed.

It implies a conscious recognition or understanding of something's existence, characteristics, or state.

This can range from simple sensory awareness, such as noticing a sound or seeing a color, to more complex forms of awareness that involve understanding and contextualizing information, such as being aware of a social issue or understanding an abstract complex concept.

Awareness can be immediate and direct, as when you become aware of a bright light or a loud noise, or it can be indirect and mediated by thought, such as becoming aware of someone's feelings through their words and actions, or understanding a concept through learning.

Being aware also implies a level of attention and focus; one actively notices or pays attention to something, distinguishing it from mere passive reception of information.

Overall, to be aware of something means to be **consciously cognizant** of it, whether it is an external object, an internal thought or feeling, or a more abstract concept, involving both sensory perception and cognitive processes in the recognition and understanding of that thing.

## The Spectrum of Awareness

### Memory

Consciousness extends into the cognitive domain, where specific cues or inputs can trigger the retrieval of memories, bringing them into our current awareness.

For instance, the mention of childhood can evoke a vivid recollection of childhood experiences, demonstrating how consciousness can shift focus based on cognitive stimuli.

This fluidity suggests that consciousness encompasses not just our immediate sensory perceptions but also the broader tapestry of our memories and experiences, which can be accessed or receded from awareness.

While our memories contribute to a heightened level of consciousness, many memories lay dormant in our brains, only called upon when specific thoughts or inputs cause them to feed back into our awareness.

### Sensory Perception

The act of perceiving someone or something directly impacts our consciousness of their existence. When you see a person, your awareness that this person exists is heightened; they occupy a more significant part of your conscious experience at that moment. In that moment, **you become conscious of that person**.

Whilst you may not be fully conscious of that persons entire inner state, you can still can often percieve their emotions, actions, or behavior.

There are many kinds of external sensory perceptions, ranging from sight, sound, touch, taste, small, temperature, pressure and more. Each of these senses has its own unique properties and functions, and they all contribute to our overall awareness of the world around us.

There's also many kinds of internal sensory perceptions, such as proprioception, which is the sense of our own body position and movement. This can be used to navigate our environment, detect our surroundings, and even detect our own presence - it's why some of us can't tickle ourselves.

### Loss of senses

When an individual becomes paralyzed, they may lose consciousness of the affected body parts in the sense that they no longer have direct sensory feedback or motor control over those body parts.

This change can lead to a profound alteration in how one experiences their body and the world. Yet, this doesn't necessarily completely remove the person's overall consciousness experience, merely diminishes itâ€™s contents and focus, reinforcing the idea of consciousness as a spectrum that can shift and evolve with changes in sensory and motor capacities.

Similarly, when a person becomes blind, they lose a rich form of consciousness, often their brains will compensate to adjust and allocate it's resources to heightening other senses such as sound and touch.
