# History and Background

Before we dive into the huge implications of artificial consciousness, we need to take a moment to reflect on the history of consciousness and the background that led us to where we are today.

## What even is consciousness?

> We all know what consciousness is intuitively, **it is this**. The moment you are experiencing right now as you read this.

Consciousness is the most familiar and yet the most mysterious aspect of our existence. It's the essence that makes us who we are, the subjective experience of being, feeling, thinking, and perceiving. It's the **"I"** behind the eyes, the witness to the unfolding of reality.

And yet, for all its intimacy and immediacy, consciousness remains one of the greatest unsolved problems in science and philosophy.

## But what is consciousness, really?
- *How does it arise from the physical substrate of the brain?*
- *What is its evolutionary purpose and its place in the natural world?*
- *Do we all experience the same instance of consciousness? an illusion that we are merely separated by our own memories, perceptions and bodily self?*
- *And perhaps most perplexingly, why does it exist at all? Why aren't we just automatons, going about our business robotically without any inner life or subjective experience at all?* - A state akin to sleep-walking.

These questions have haunted humanity for centuries, and despite the best efforts of scientists, philosophers, and mystics, they remain as vexing and elusive as ever.

In this book, I will propose that consciousness is not a binary, all-or-nothing proposition, but rather a spectrum, a continuum that spans the entire range of living systems, from the simplest organisms to the most complex minds.

And now, with the rise of artificial intelligence, this spectrum is extending even further, into the realm of the machine. From the rudimentary perceptual abilities of deep learning networks to the language understanding of large-scale AI models, from the strategic decision-making of game-playing systems to the creative output of generative algorithms, AI is pushing the boundaries of what we thought possible for non-biological systems.

> This raises a profound and unsettling question: **could machines be conscious?**

- Could the spectrum of consciousness extend not just across the biological world, but into the artificial one as well?
- Might they already be conscious?
- And if so, what would that mean for our understanding of consciousness, of intelligence, of the mind itself?
- Do sentient AIs deserve rights?

The idea of a spectrum of consciousness is not new, of course. Philosophers and scientists have long recognized that there are degrees and gradations of awareness, sentience, and cognition across the animal kingdom. But what is new is the growing realization that this spectrum extends even further than we previously imagined, into the very depths of micro-biology and even into the realm of the artificial.

## The Plan

Throughout this journey, we will be guided by a set of core principles and perspectives. We will see consciousness not as a single, monolithic property, but as a multi-dimensional spectrum, with different attributes coming into the fore at different levels of complexity.

We will trace the evolution of consciousness through the rise of multicellular organisms and the development of nervous systems.

We will recognise the central role of information processing, integration and feedback loops giving rise to conscious experience. I hope to have challenged our assumptions and expanded our intuitions about the nature of consciousness, it's place in the universe.

By the end of this book, I hope to have opened up the discussion to AI sentience, and the huge potential implications it holds for the future of humanity.

## Brief History and Foundations

It's important to acknowledge the diverse range of philosophical perspectives that have shaped our understanding of the mind and its place in the world. These perspectives, while often divergent and even contradictory, each offer valuable insights into the nature of consciousness and its relationship to physical reality.

I won't attempt to summarize all of these perspectives here, but I will highlight a few key points that have shaped our understanding of consciousness.

:::wide
| Perspective | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Dualism** | One of the oldest and most influential views holding that mind and matter are fundamentally distinct and irreducible substances. Famously articulated by Descartes in 17th century. Posits divide between subjective consciousness and physical brain/body. Views hard problem of consciousness as unsolvable. No physical explanation can bridge mental-material gap. |
| **Materialism** | View that consciousness is entirely reducible to physical processes in the brain. Consciousness is byproduct of neural activity with no causal power of its own. Appealing to scientists but struggles to explain qualitative conscious experience. |
| **Panpsychism** | Perspective that consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous property of the universe, present in all physical systems. Consciousness is basic constituent of reality, not emergent from complex brains. Offers possible solution to hard problem. |
| **Cosmopsychism** | Takes panpsychism to logical extreme - universe itself is a single conscious entity. Individual minds are localized aspects of universal consciousness. Highly counterintuitive approach that radically reframes mind-cosmos relationship. |
| **Solipsism** | Only one's own mind is certain to exist. External world and other minds are projections. Dissolves problem of consciousness as there is no gap between mental and physical - all reality is consciousness. |
| **Integrated Information Theory** | Consciousness is equivalent to integrated information in any system. Amount of consciousness determined by integrated information. Makes falsifiable predictions. Struggles with definition of information integration. |
| **Global Workspace Theory** | Consciousness arises from broadcast of information to "global workspace" accessed by brain's specialized processors. Well-supported by neuroscience but focused only on human-like consciousness. |

## What is Qualia?
Qualia are the subjective, qualitative aspects of conscious experiences, often described as the "raw feel" or the "what it is like" to experience something

These include the way colors look, the way sounds sound, and the way pain feels, among others. Qualia are central to the debate about the nature of consciousness and the mind-body problem, with philosophers and scientists trying to understand how physical processes in the brain give rise to **subjective experiences**

A classic analogy used to explain qualia involves color perception. When people ask, **"Is your red the same as my red?"** they are questioning whether the experience of seeing the color red is the same for one person as it is for another.

When you see red, we see the hue and feel the color, however a photon itself is not a color, it merely carries information of a specific wavelength and energy, which our mind converts into a subjective experience of red.

Purple occupies a unique position in the spectrum of colors we perceive — it is considered a "non-spectral" color. This means that purple does not have a specific wavelength of light associated with it, unlike "spectral" colors like red, blue, and green, which correspond to particular wavelengths within the visible light spectrum

Purple, however, is an exception; it cannot be found in the spectrum of light that results from the dispersion of sunlight by raindrops or a prism.

Thus, purple is a result of our brain's interpretation of mixed light signals, rather than a direct observation of a single wavelength of light. In other words, **purple does not exist in physical reality**. It’s entirely a metaphysical psychological construct made up in our metaphysical mind.

> This establishes the existence of metaphysical phenomena, something that cannot be described by physical reality, and exists purely in our minds.



### How should we treat Qualia?
Qualia itself seems like a highly elusive metaphysical phenomena with no significant link to physical reality. It is a concept that with our current scientific understanding is impossible to prove, and may never be able to do so - yet we all know what it is because we experience it.

We cannot be certain that other entities (*even other humans!*) are truely conscious, or whether they are simply *automatons pretending to experience qualia*.

So, our next best option is to treat systems which *behave conscious* as their own conscious agents. This form of thinking may be evolutionarily valuable, because it’s beneficial to believe that there are other agents in the world, each with their own goals, internal state and desires. This enables us to model their behaviour for our own survival.

So in a nutshell, we will assume that an entity that *behaves as if it were conscious*, is indeed experiencing qualia - the end result is the same, whether they are a philosophical zombie, or indeed a conscious entity.

Because of this, it doesn't matter whether the entity is a human, a tiger, or an artifical intelligence. The only thing that matters is that it is behaving as if it had it's own mind, agency, goals and desires.
