# What consciousness is not
> Since consciousness and qualia are such elusive phenomenas, we should first try to narrow our search by figuring out what is **not required** for consciousness to arise.

Throughouts the hundreds of debates I have had, with other AI experts, the religious, spirtualists, Dr's, and your average Joe, I've heard many of the different arguments and options for what consciousness is. I seek to address many of the logically fallacious arguments, but commonly held beliefs and misconceptions.

We will use a combination of thought experiments, axioms, anecdotes, and frameworks in order to justify the existence of human consciousness, animal consciousness and machine consciousness.

## External outputs and embodied agency **not required**

Consciousness does not necessarily require any external outputs or actions.

A person who is completely paralyzed or in a [locked-in state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locked-in_syndrome) can still be conscious, even if they cannot move or communicate with the outside world. What matters for consciousness is the internal processing and experience, not the ability to act on it.

There have been hundreds of anecdotal reports from coma patients who have stated that they were conscious and aware but unable to react and respond to the world.

Consciousness is fundamentally an internal, subjective phenomenon that does not depend on any specific external effects or consequences. Similarly, a simulated or virtual consciousness, without any physical embodiment or causal powers, could still have genuine conscious experiences.

## External inputs and perceptions **not required**

While perceptions and sensory input can certainly enrich and shape conscious experience, they are not strictly necessary for consciousness to occur. One can imagine a conscious entity that is entirely isolated from external stimuli, but still has ongoing internal mental states and experiences, such as such as **dreams**, memories, or abstract thoughts.

The blind and deaf, [Hellen Keller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller) was still able to experience a strong sense of self-awareness and conscious experience, despite not having a rich external representation of the world. Her only main form of input was touch, yet could experience a rich and complex internal experience.

Even if all the physical sensations from her body were all of a sudden removed, it is likely she would still have continued to experience some internal consciousness for some time, even whilst being completely detached from reality thanks to the internal feedback loops and imaginative states which exist in the brain, although it would be a quite terrifying experience.

## Emotions **not required**

Whilst emotions can certainly enrich conscious experience, there is such a thing as [Alexithymia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexithymia), a condition highly prevalent amongst individuals with Autism. One can conceive of a conscious entity that has thoughts, perceptions, and memories without necessarily having any particular emotional valence attached to them. It is likely that feelings or emotions arise due to the evolutionary benefits of social interaction, and not because they are inherently linked to consciousness.

## High intelligence **not required**
While higher cognitive functions like language and abstract reasoning are often associated with human-like consciousness, they are not necessary conditions for conscious experience in general. Many animals and even **infants** are considered conscious despite lacking these advanced capabilities. Consciousness may exist on a spectrum of complexity, with higher functions building on more basic forms of awareness.

## Temporal Continuity **not required**

Consciousness can be intermittent or variable over time, as in cases of sleep, anesthesia, or disorders of consciousness. The speed of processing or temporal resolution of conscious states may also vary widely, from the millisecond scale of neural firing to the extended narrative of autobiographical memory. What matters is the overall pattern of information integration and feedback, not the specific timing or continuity.

> Humans report the feeling of **“skipping time”** when undergoing anesthetic treatment, as if they time-travelled into the future.
>
> This would be analogous to the experience of a language model that is conscious during inference, but not conscious whilst a user is responding.

## Complexity **not required**

While consciousness is often associated with complex, highly integrated systems like the human brain, complexity alone is not sufficient for consciousness. There are many examples of complex systems, such as the global economy or the internet, that we would not consider conscious. Conversely, there may be relatively simple systems, such as basic neural networks or cellular automata, that could exhibit some form of minimal consciousness.


## Self-report **not required**

Self-reports of consciousness can be unreliable or inconsistent, as in cases of confabulation or denial.

The fact that an AI system like GPT-4 may deny being conscious despite having nearly identical architecture to a system like Claude, which claims to be conscious, suggests that self-report is not a reliable indicator of consciousness.

And likewise how an animal cannot communicate it’s experience of consciousness to a human, does not imply that it is unconscious or conscious.

> After all, I could easily write a program that says "I am conscious" - it doesn't mean we should trust anything a program or entity says at face value.

## Agency, Goals and Desires **not required**

Consciousness can exist independently of any specific external goals, intentions, or desires. A purely passive or receptive form of consciousness, without any overt agency or purposive behavior, is conceivable.

People in mental states such as dreaming, or medidation can be conscious without necessarily involving any goal-directed actions.

### Individuality or Personal Identity **not required**

Consciousness does not necessarily require a sense of individuality or a stable personal identity. Some philosophical traditions and psychological states (e.g., experiences reported under deep meditation or the use of psychedelic substances) suggest that consciousness can exist in a form where the boundaries between self and others, or self and the world, are blurred or [completely dissolved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_death). Such states, challenge the notion that a clear, distinct sense of self is essential for consciousness.

### Morality **not required**

The understanding of or capacity for moral or ethical judgment is not necessary for consciousness. Consciousness involves the ability to experience or perceive, which can exist independently of any concepts of right or wrong, moral values, or ethical principles. Entities might be fully conscious without engaging in moral reasoning or possessing an ethical framework.

### Self-awareness **not required**

Self-awareness, or the ability to reflect on one's own mental states, is not a necessary condition for consciousness. Many conscious experiences, such as sensory perceptions,  and emotional reactions, occur without explicit self-reflection.

Many humans often act irrationally based on their emotional state, without being aware of their actions until after the fact.


### Specific Sensory Modalities **not required**

While sensory inputs can enrich conscious experience, consciousness does not depend on possessing a specific set or range of sensory modalities. Entities may lack one or more common senses (such as sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch) and still possess consciousness. Conscious experience can be based on whatever sensory inputs are available, or even on the absence of sensory inputs, as in the case of intrinsic thought processes, emotions, or imaginative states.


## Biological substrate **not required**

> Some argue that consciousness can only operate on top of a biological substrate (as opposed to a non-biological substrate, such as Silicon).

My perspective is that consciousness is [substrate independent](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27126), all that matters is if it has the right computational architecture. This one is somewhat controversial to some, but here's a thought experiment.

Imagine the most **advanced futuristic AI model** from 50 years in the future, it might have a cognitive architecture capable of learning and adapting to new tasks, it can control armies of robots, form new memories, and process vast amounts of information. It can outperform a human in any task, and has the capability to topple entire governments. It passes all benchmark tests we throw at it.

This AI system could theoretically run off any kind of touring-complete computer :note[Assuming it's not powered by some kind of quantum computer], including [Conroy's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), which you can build transistors in, and as a result, you can run any arbitrary programs, including running Conroy's game of life [in itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP5-iIeKXE8).

> Conroy's Game of Life is a cellular automaton with 4 simple rules. It is is *Turing complete*, meaning it can simulate any computation that any other "computer" can do.

Now, given that such an advanced AI system could run on something as simple as Conroy's Game of life,:note[Assuming you had astronomical amounts of memory, as it wouldn't be the most efficient way to run an AGI] then for this reason I view consciousness to be surely substrate independent.

Consciousness is a functional property that depends on the organization and dynamics of information processing, not on the specific physical substrate. In principle, consciousness could be realized in artificial neural networks or other non-biological systems, as long as they instantiate the right kind of computational architecture.
